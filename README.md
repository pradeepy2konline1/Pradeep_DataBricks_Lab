# Pradeep_DataBricks_Lab
Context Setting:
As a part of self learning and upskilling, I have created this repository. 
Here, I am creating a reference architecture and putting it into use practically by fetching data from S3, stream them using Apache Spark's Structured Streaming and publish into Delta table using Databricks ecosystem. At the time of this writing, I have created my own Databricks instance on AWS.
